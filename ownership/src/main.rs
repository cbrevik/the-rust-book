    // * All the integer types, such as u32.
    // * The Boolean type, bool, with values true and false.
    // * All the floating point types, such as f64.
    // * The character type, char.
    // * Tuples, if they only contain types that are also Copy. For example, (i32, i32) is Copy, but (i32, String) is not.

    // Passing a variable to a function will move or copy, just as assignment does:
    takes_ownership(s2);

    // println!("{}", s2); won't compile since its been moved

    // In short, about references:
    // * At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
    // * References must always be valid.

    // A string slice is a reference to part of a String, and it looks like this:
